# Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio project completed as part of a course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org). The project focuses on creating a single-page portfolio website to showcase my work as a frontend developer. It incorporates various technologies and libraries including React, Chakra UI, Formik, and Yup.

## Features

- **Header:** A header component with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page. The header also includes a show/hide animation based on scroll direction.
  
- **Landing Section:** A landing section featuring an avatar picture, a greeting, and a brief role description.

- **Projects Section:** A section to display featured projects as cards in a grid fashion. Each card includes information about the project title, description, and an option to learn more.

- **Contact Me Section:** A section with a form to allow visitors to contact me. The form includes input fields for name, email address, type of inquiry, and message. Form validation and submission are handled using Formik and Yup, with feedback provided through alerts.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Utilized for building the frontend components and managing the state of the application.
  
- **Chakra UI:** Used for styling the UI components and creating a cohesive design system.

- **Formik and Yup:** Employed for form management and validation, providing a seamless user experience in the contact form.

- **FontAwesome:** Integrated for displaying social media icons and arrows in the UI components.
